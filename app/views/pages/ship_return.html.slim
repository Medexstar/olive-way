              p Tailoring is hard and we understand that it can be a complicated process. So, if youâ€™re not 100% happy with your product,
                you can send it back to our Melbourne office. We will do the alternations for you, free of charge. If you would rather
                have it altered in your city, we also offer up to $100 in alternation money for each client which we are more than happy
                to reimburse you for. Your satisfaction is our number one priority, so we will venture to do anything we can to make
                this experience as smooth as possible for you.
