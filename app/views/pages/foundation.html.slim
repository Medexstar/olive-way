              p The Foundation is very important to us. It tells a story. It gives us purpose. More purpose than

              p Olive Way began in early 2016, in the heart of Udaipur, India. While travelling through the Indian fashion capital,
                our CEO and Co-founder Ryan made a close connection with an amazing third-generation tailoring family.

              p As a result, we’ve grown this business, trying our hardest to provide a sustainable income for Prateek and his family.
                Unfortunately, there are many, many more families that need our and your support.

              p That’s why we have decided to team up with ‘The Hunger Project’. The Hunger Project is an amazing charity organisation that
                was started in California in 1977, helping communities in India and elsewhere break their cycle of poverty,
                and aiding them in building a sustainable community. We have partnered with The Hunger Project,
                and have committed to giving them 10% of our profits, to help families in and around India.
                We really hope that this initiative will help make a difference.
